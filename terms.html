    <div class="page-title">Terms of Service</div>
    <div class="page-co">OGENTI, Inc. &nbsp;·&nbsp; Effective February 21, 2026 &nbsp;·&nbsp; Version 1.0</div>

    <p>Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms", "Agreement") carefully before accessing or using the ogenti desktop application, any associated application programming interfaces, websites, documentation, or other services provided or made available by OGENTI, Inc. ("Company", "we", "us", or "our") (collectively, the "Service"). These Terms constitute a legally binding agreement between you ("User", "you") and the Company. By installing, accessing, or using the Service in any manner, you affirm that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms in their entirety. If you are using the Service on behalf of a legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that entity to these Terms, and "you" shall refer to that entity. If you do not agree to any provision of these Terms, you must not use the Service.</p>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <h2>1. Definitions</h2>
    <p>For the purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have the meanings ascribed to them herein, and such meanings shall be equally applicable to both the singular and plural forms of the terms defined:</p>
    <p><strong>"Agent"</strong> means an autonomous or semi-autonomous software process, script, workflow, or artificial intelligence model configured, deployed, or operated through the Service, including any Agent obtained from the Marketplace or independently developed by a User.</p>
    <p><strong>"Agent Developer"</strong> means any individual or legal entity that creates, submits, publishes, distributes, or makes available an Agent through the Marketplace or through any interface provided by the Service.</p>
    <p><strong>"Agent Output"</strong> means any data, text, code, media, action, decision, communication, or other result produced, generated, or initiated by an Agent during its operation.</p>
    <p><strong>"Marketplace"</strong> means the in-application agent distribution platform operated by the Company through which Agent Developers may publish Agents and Users may discover, install, and deploy Agents.</p>
    <p><strong>"Credits"</strong> means the internal digital tokens used within the Service to facilitate operations, transactions, and interactions, including but not limited to agent execution, marketplace purchases, and community features.</p>
    <p><strong>"Content"</strong> means all information, data, text, code, configurations, prompts, responses, and materials that are submitted, uploaded, generated, or transmitted through the Service.</p>
    <p><strong>"Authorized User"</strong> means an individual who has been granted access to the Service under a registered account and has accepted these Terms.</p>
    <p><strong>"Third-Party Materials"</strong> means any content, data, software, services, or APIs that are owned or operated by a party other than the Company and that are accessed, used, or integrated in connection with the Service.</p>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <h2>2. Description of the Service</h2>
    <p>ogenti is an autonomous AI agent platform delivered as a desktop application for Microsoft Windows. The Service enables Authorized Users to create, configure, schedule, deploy, monitor, and interact with Agents capable of executing complex multi-step tasks, interacting with external services, generating Content, and operating with varying degrees of user supervision. The Service includes, without limitation: the core agent runtime environment; a community-driven Marketplace for discovering and distributing Agents; an internal credit economy; social features including community posts, voting, and reputation systems; and associated developer tooling and APIs.</p>
    <p>The Service is currently made available as a <strong>closed beta</strong> product. Features, functionality, pricing, performance characteristics, and availability are subject to change at any time and without prior notice. Beta access does not confer any entitlement to continued access, future pricing, or specific feature sets. The Company may, at its sole discretion, discontinue the beta program, transition to a paid service, or modify access criteria at any time.</p>
    <p>The Company reserves the right to perform scheduled or emergency maintenance on any part of the Service infrastructure without liability for any resulting interruption of access. The Company does not represent or warrant any specific uptime, availability, or service level for the beta product.</p>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <h2>3. Account Registration & Security</h2>
    <p>You must register and maintain an account to access the core functionality of the Service. When registering, you agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information as prompted by the registration process, and to update that information promptly if it changes. You must be at least fourteen (14) years of age to create an account or use the Service. If you are between the ages of 14 and 18 (or the applicable age of majority in your jurisdiction), you represent that you have obtained verifiable consent from a parent or legal guardian who has read and agreed to these Terms on your behalf. By creating an account, you represent and warrant that you meet the applicable age requirement.</p>
    <p>You are solely and exclusively responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of your account credentials, including your password, API keys, and any multi-factor authentication methods. You agree not to share your credentials with any other person and not to permit any other person to access the Service using your credentials. You agree to implement reasonable security measures to prevent unauthorized access to your account, including using strong and unique passwords and enabling available security features.</p>
    <p>You are fully responsible for all activities, actions, and transactions that occur under your account, whether authorized or unauthorized. You must notify the Company immediately upon becoming aware of any unauthorized access to or use of your account, any compromise of your credentials, or any other security incident relating to your account, by contacting <a href="mailto:security@ogenti.com">security@ogenti.com</a>. The Company shall not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with these obligations.</p>
    <p>The Company reserves the right to refuse registration, cancel accounts, or restrict access to the Service at its sole discretion, including where the Company has reason to believe that applicable laws, regulations, or these Terms have been or are likely to be violated.</p>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <h2>4. Credits, Payments & Transactions</h2>
    <p>The Service incorporates an internal digital currency system ("Credits") that governs the economics of agent execution, Marketplace transactions, community interactions, and other platform activities. Credits are functional utility tokens within the Service ecosystem and do not constitute legal tender, a financial instrument, a security, or any other regulated financial product under the laws of the Republic of Korea or any other applicable jurisdiction, to the best of the Company's current understanding. Users are solely responsible for determining the tax and regulatory implications of Credit transactions in their respective jurisdictions.</p>
    <p>Credits may be acquired through: (a) base allocations provided gratuitously by the Company during the beta period; (b) earning mechanisms tied to Agent performance, community engagement, or referral programs as defined by the Company from time to time; (c) peer-to-peer transfers from other Authorized Users; or (d) direct purchase through payment channels made available by the Company. The Company makes no guarantees regarding the continued availability of any earning mechanism or allocation program.</p>
    <p><strong>Credit Exchange (Buy & Sell).</strong> The Service provides a Credit exchange mechanism through which Users may: (i) purchase Credits using fiat currency at the prevailing Credit exchange rate; and (ii) sell Credits back to the platform in exchange for fiat currency payout, subject to applicable fees, daily transaction limits, and eligibility conditions. The exchange rate is dynamic and is calculated based on platform supply-demand metrics, total Credit volume, and active agent count as determined by the Company's exchange algorithm. The Company reserves the right to modify the exchange rate, fee structure, and transaction limits at any time. The current sell fee is charged as a percentage of gross payout value, as displayed within the application at the time of transaction. A daily sell limit per account applies and is subject to change. The Company does not guarantee any minimum exchange rate or payout amount.</p>
    <p>All Credit transactions executed within the Service are recorded in a ledger maintained by the Company and are considered final and irreversible upon confirmation, except as expressly provided herein or as required by applicable law. The Company does not provide refunds for Credits spent on Agent executions, Marketplace purchases, or other Service operations. In the case of a verified technical error caused solely by the Company's infrastructure, the Company may, at its sole discretion, issue a Credit adjustment, but is not obligated to do so. All fiat currency payments are processed by third-party payment processors; the applicable payment processor's terms govern those transactions and the Company is not responsible for errors, failures, or disputes arising at the payment processing layer.</p>
    <p>Credits are associated with the account to which they are allocated and are non-transferable except through the designated peer-to-peer transfer functionality within the Service. Credits that are unused at the time of account termination, whether voluntary or involuntary, may be subject to a sell-out procedure during the account offboarding period; Credits not sold or transferred prior to final account deletion are forfeited, except where mandatory consumer protection laws of your jurisdiction require otherwise.</p>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <h2>5. Agent Marketplace, Developer Obligations & Allocation of Liability</h2>
    <p>The Marketplace is a platform through which Agent Developers may publish, distribute, and monetize Agents, and through which Users may discover, obtain, and deploy such Agents. The Company acts solely as the operator of the distribution infrastructure; it is not the developer, publisher, author, or operator of any third-party Agent listed on the Marketplace. The Company does not endorse, sponsor, or assume responsibility for any third-party Agent or its outputs.</p>
    <p>Agent Developers who publish Agents on the Marketplace are required to comply with the Company's Marketplace Submission Guidelines, these Terms, and all applicable laws and regulations. By submitting an Agent to the Marketplace, an Agent Developer represents and warrants that: (a) the Agent does not infringe any intellectual property rights of any third party; (b) the Agent does not contain malicious code, backdoors, or unauthorized data collection mechanisms; (c) the Agent complies with all applicable data protection laws with respect to any personal data it may process; (d) the Agent's functionality, capabilities, and limitations are accurately described in its listing; and (e) the Agent Developer has obtained all necessary rights, licenses, and consents to publish and distribute the Agent.</p>
    <p>The Company conducts a review and verification process for Agents submitted to the Marketplace. This process is designed to evaluate Agents against the Company's technical standards and policy requirements, screen for evident security vulnerabilities, malicious functionality, and violations of these Terms. The completion of this review process and the publication of an Agent on the Marketplace does not constitute the Company's guarantee, certification, warranty, or endorsement of the Agent's safety, accuracy, reliability, fitness for any purpose, or legal compliance. The review process represents a best-effort, good-faith evaluation conducted at the time of submission and does not account for changes in Agent behavior, third-party API behavior, or operational contexts that arise after publication.</p>
    <p>Each Agent Developer bears full, exclusive, and non-transferable legal responsibility and liability for all aspects of their Agent's design, operation, and outputs. This responsibility includes, without limitation: the accuracy and reliability of Agent Outputs; compliance with all applicable laws and regulations governing the Agent's functionality and the industries or use cases in which the Agent operates; all consequences arising from erroneous, unexpected, or harmful Agent behavior; any financial harm, data loss, privacy violations, reputational damage, or physical harm suffered by Users or third parties as a result of Agent operations; and any regulatory fines, sanctions, or enforcement actions arising from the Agent's activities. The completion of the Company's review process does not transfer, reduce, or in any way limit the Agent Developer's liability to Users, third parties, or regulatory authorities.</p>
    <p>Users who deploy or interact with third-party Agents acknowledge that they do so at their own risk. The Company strongly recommends that Users conduct independent due diligence, including reviewing Agent documentation, community ratings, published reviews, and the Agent Developer's public profile, before deploying any Agent in production or high-stakes environments. Users are responsible for supervising Agent activities to the extent reasonably practicable and for implementing appropriate safeguards.</p>

    <div class="divider"></div>

Violations may result in the immediate suspension, restriction, or permanent termination of your account, forfeiture of Credits, and, where appropriate, referral to law enforcement authorities.</p>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <h2>7. Intellectual Property Rights</h2>
    <p>As between you and the Company, the Company owns and retains all rights, title, and interest in and to the Service, including all software, algorithms, models, infrastructure, visual design, trademarks, trade names, service marks, logos, documentation, and all other intellectual property embodied in or associated with the Service ("Company IP"). These Terms do not convey to you any ownership interest in the Company IP. The limited licenses granted herein are not a sale or transfer of any intellectual property rights.</p>
    <p>Subject to your continued compliance with these Terms, the Company grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to install and use the Service on your personal device solely for your own internal purposes in accordance with these Terms. You agree not to: (a) copy, reproduce, or distribute the Service or any portion thereof; (b) modify, adapt, translate, or create derivative works based on the Service; (c) reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code of the Service except to the extent expressly permitted by applicable law; (d) remove, alter, or obscure any proprietary notices, labels, or marks on or in the Service.</p>
    <p>You retain all rights, title, and interest in and to Content that you create, configure, or input into the Service, including the source code and configuration files of Agents that you develop. By publishing an Agent to the Marketplace, you grant the Company a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable license to list, display, host, distribute, and make available your Agent to other Users of the Marketplace during the term of your listing. This license does not extend to ownership of your Agent's underlying intellectual property.</p>
    <p>The Company does not claim ownership of Agent Outputs generated during your use of the Service. You acknowledge that the intellectual property status of AI-generated content may vary by jurisdiction and that the Company makes no representation regarding the copyrightability or legal status of Agent Outputs under the laws of any particular jurisdiction.</p>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <h2>8. Data Practices & Privacy</h2>
    <p>By using the Service, you acknowledge and agree to the Company's Privacy Policy, which is incorporated into these Terms by reference and available at <a href="privacy.html">privacy.html</a>. In the event of any conflict between these Terms and the Privacy Policy with respect to data practices, the Privacy Policy shall control.</p>
    <p>The Service is architected to maximize local processing. Agent execution, configuration data, conversation history, and Agent Outputs are stored primarily on your local device and are not routinely transmitted to Company servers. Company servers handle account authentication, credit ledger management, Marketplace operations, and community features. You acknowledge that use of certain optional features may require transmission of data to Company servers, and you will be informed of such requirements within the application before enabling those features.</p>
    <p>You are responsible for ensuring that your use of the Service, including any personal data processed by Agents you configure or deploy, complies with all applicable data protection and privacy laws. Where Agents process personal data of third parties, you assume the role of data controller and bear all associated legal obligations. The Company, where applicable, acts as a data processor and will process such data only in accordance with your instructions and applicable law.</p>
    <p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may collect and use aggregated, anonymized, non-personally identifiable data derived from your use of the Service for the purposes of improving the Service, developing new features, and conducting internal research and analytics. Such data will not be used to identify you personally.</p>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <h2>9. Third-Party Materials & Integrations</h2>
    <p>The Service may provide features that allow Agents to access, integrate with, or rely upon Third-Party Materials, including external APIs, large language model providers such as OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google, web services, databases, and other external data sources. The availability, terms, pricing, performance, and reliability of Third-Party Materials are entirely outside the Company's control and are subject to the terms of service and policies of the respective third-party providers.</p>
    <p>Your use of Third-Party Materials through the Service is governed by the applicable third-party provider's terms and policies, and you are solely responsible for complying with those terms. The Company does not warrant the accuracy, completeness, availability, or reliability of any Third-Party Materials and does not assume liability for any harm arising from your use of or reliance on Third-Party Materials. Changes to third-party APIs or service terms may disrupt Agent functionality, and the Company has no obligation to maintain compatibility with any particular third-party service.</p>
    <p>Any links to third-party websites or resources provided within the Service are for convenience only. The Company does not endorse, and is not responsible for, the content, products, services, or practices of any third-party websites.</p>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <h2>10. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE SERVICE, ALL AGENTS (INCLUDING THOSE PUBLISHED ON THE MARKETPLACE), ALL CONTENT, AND ALL AGENT OUTPUTS ARE PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND. THE COMPANY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND WARRANTIES ARISING FROM A COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE.</p>

    <p>SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES. TO THE EXTENT SUCH EXCLUSIONS ARE PROHIBITED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, THOSE EXCLUSIONS SHALL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED.</p>
